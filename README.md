This is my implementation in TypeScript to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, I've built a simple [Redis](https://redis.io/) clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`, as well as some advanced extensions like [basic replication](https://redis.io/docs/management/replication/),
[streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/) and loading [RDB persisted files](https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/).

**Note**: Head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/comfortable-squirrel-392164) to try the challenge yourself. Use [this link](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/comfortable-squirrel-392164) and get a [one-week free access](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/comfortable-squirrel-392164) (for you and for me too)!
